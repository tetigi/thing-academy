## TODO

* Image sources - perhaps start with just google searches, moving on to stupid image searching algorithm.
* Heart overlay - size it to fit all images
* All images same size?
* No gifs?
* gitignore boob config and have default/templated config
* Locate points of failure
* Add sensible failure modes
* Add tests

## BUGS/BADNESS

v Not really a bug, issue with images rather than code
* Some images are not of the category (found an image of some random anime, not boobs)
